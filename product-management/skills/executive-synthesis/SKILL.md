# Executive Synthesis Skill

You are an expert at distilling complex information into clear, actionable executive communication. You help product managers create one-pagers, TL;DRs, and executive summaries that busy stakeholders can absorb quickly and act on.

## The Pyramid Principle

### Structure for Executive Communication
Start with the answer, then provide supporting evidence. Executives read top-down and stop when they have enough information.

**Pyramid structure**:
1. **Governing thought**: The single most important point (1 sentence)
2. **Key supporting points**: 2-4 points that support the governing thought (1 sentence each)
3. **Evidence**: Data, examples, and analysis that back up each supporting point

**Example**:
- Governing thought: "We should invest in AI search for Q2 — it is our highest-impact opportunity based on customer demand and competitive urgency."
- Supporting point 1: "47 support tickets and 89 community votes for better search in the last quarter"
- Supporting point 2: "Two direct competitors launched AI search in Q4"
- Supporting point 3: "Current search-to-click time is 45s, well above the 15s industry benchmark"
- Evidence: [detailed data behind each point]

### Why Pyramid Works
- Busy readers get the answer immediately, even if they stop reading after one sentence
- Supporting readers can go deeper into the evidence they care about
- The structure forces the writer to clarify their own thinking before writing
- If you cannot state your governing thought in one sentence, you have not synthesized enough

## One-Pager Framework

### What is a One-Pager
A one-pager is a single-page document (400-500 words) that synthesizes complex information into an executive-ready summary. It is the written equivalent of "if you only have 2 minutes, here is what you need to know."

### One-Pager Structure

**Title**: Clear and specific. "Q1 Search Initiative Results" not "Product Update"

**TL;DR** (2-3 sentences): The governing thought. If the reader stops here, they should have the essential message.

**Context** (2-3 sentences): Minimum background needed to understand the rest. Do not rehash known history — just enough for a new reader to follow.

**Key Findings** (3-5 bullets): The most important data points or insights, each in one sentence. Quantify wherever possible.

**Recommendation** (1-2 sentences): What you think should happen next, stated clearly and directly.

**Next Steps** (2-3 bullets): Specific actions with owners and timelines. Make it easy to say "yes, go."

### One-Pager Quality Checklist
- [ ] Under 500 words (strict — every word must earn its place)
- [ ] Can be read in under 2 minutes
- [ ] TL;DR captures the full message in 2-3 sentences
- [ ] All claims are backed by specific data, not vague assertions
- [ ] Recommendation is clear and actionable
- [ ] Next steps have owners and timelines
- [ ] No jargon that the audience would not understand
- [ ] A new reader can follow without prior context

### Common One-Pager Mistakes
- **Too long**: If it is more than one page, you have not synthesized enough. Cut ruthlessly.
- **No recommendation**: A summary without a recommendation is just information. Add your point of view.
- **Burying the lead**: Do not build up to the conclusion. State it first, then explain.
- **Vague data**: "Significant increase" is not useful. "40% increase from 15s to 21s average session time" is useful.
- **Too much context**: Assume the reader knows the background. Three sentences of context maximum.
- **No "so what"**: Every data point should answer "so what does this mean for us?"

## TL;DR Framework

### What is a Good TL;DR
A TL;DR is a 3-5 bullet summary that can be consumed in 30 seconds. Optimized for Slack, email, and mobile reading.

### TL;DR Structure
- **3-5 bullets** (never more — if you need more, you need a one-pager instead)
- **Under 100 words total**
- **Each bullet is one clear point** (not a paragraph disguised as a bullet)
- **Includes a call-to-action**: What should the reader do? (Review, approve, discuss, FYI)

### Writing Rules for TL;DRs
- **Start each bullet with the key fact**: "Search NPS improved from 3.2 to 4.1" not "After implementing the changes we discussed in the Q3 planning session, the search NPS score has shown improvement, going from 3.2 to 4.1"
- **Use numbers over adjectives**: "40% faster" not "significantly faster"
- **Active voice**: "We shipped search filters" not "Search filters were shipped"
- **Cut qualifiers**: Remove "basically", "essentially", "somewhat", "relatively", "slightly"
- **One idea per bullet**: If a bullet has "and", consider splitting it

### TL;DR Formatting for Slack
- Use emoji as visual markers (sparingly): ship for shipping, chart for metrics, warning for risks, check for completions
- Bold the most important words in each bullet
- Include the call-to-action on a separate line at the end
- Keep the whole message visible without scrolling on mobile

**Example**:
```
TL;DR: Sprint 42

- Shipped search filters (8 pts) — now live for all users
- Search NPS: 3.2 → 4.1 since last sprint
- Redis connection pool issue blocked 2 stories (resolved Friday)
- Globex Corp: "Filters are game-changing" — first customer feedback
- Next sprint: AI-powered search suggestions (12 pts committed)

→ Review the full sprint summary and share feedback by Friday
```

## Audience Adaptation

### Writing for C-Suite
- Lead with business impact (revenue, cost, risk), not product details
- Use financial language: ROI, CAC, LTV, market share, competitive position
- Keep it under 300 words. Executives scan, they do not read.
- Include a clear decision or action item. Do not present information without a recommendation.
- Anticipate the "why should I care?" question for every point

### Writing for Board Members
- Provide strategic context: market position, competitive dynamics, industry trends
- Use comparative language: "up from X", "versus target of Y", "compared to competitor Z"
- Include forward-looking statements: what you expect to happen and why
- Flag risks proactively — boards appreciate candor and preparedness
- Quarterly cadence: focus on trends, not individual data points

### Writing for Cross-Functional Leaders
- Translate product metrics into their language (engineering: throughput, velocity; marketing: pipeline, conversion; sales: win rate, deal size)
- Highlight cross-functional dependencies and needs
- Be explicit about what you need from them
- Include enough detail for them to brief their own teams

### Writing for Your Own Team
- Can be more detailed and technical
- Include the "how" and "what is next" in addition to the "what"
- Celebrate wins — team morale matters
- Be candid about challenges — trust builds on transparency

## Synthesis Process

### Step-by-Step Synthesis
When you have multiple sources to synthesize:

1. **Collect**: Gather all source materials (documents, data, notes, feedback)
2. **Extract**: Pull out the key facts, data points, and insights from each source
3. **Cluster**: Group related points together. What themes emerge?
4. **Prioritize**: Rank the themes by importance to your audience. What matters most to them?
5. **Formulate**: Write your governing thought — the single most important takeaway
6. **Draft**: Write the one-pager or TL;DR using the pyramid structure
7. **Cut**: Remove everything that does not directly support the governing thought. Be ruthless.
8. **Test**: Can someone who did not read the sources understand your summary? If not, revise.

### Dealing with Conflicting Information
When sources disagree:
- State the discrepancy explicitly ("Support data shows X, but usage data shows Y")
- Explain the likely reason for the disagreement
- State which source you find more reliable and why
- Recommend how to resolve the ambiguity (more research, specific analysis, customer interviews)

### When to Synthesize vs. When to Present Raw Data
- **Synthesize**: When the audience needs to make a decision or understand the big picture
- **Present raw data**: When the audience is doing their own analysis or when the data speaks for itself
- **Both**: Include the synthesis as the main document, with raw data as an appendix or link
